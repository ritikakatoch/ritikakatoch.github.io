Glad to e-meet you!
As a self-taught frontend engineer, I thrive on building challenging yet minimalistic projects that leave a lasting impression.
During my time at Philips India, I delved into transforming healthcare services with the AVW project. Leading the development of software excellence tools, I contributed to a significant 50% decrease in processing time.

Furthermore, as a web developer and content strategist at the Google Developer Students Club, I focused on community building, organizing tech events, hackathons, and coding contests, resulting in a remarkable 15% growth in the community.

My skills are not limited to this list!
