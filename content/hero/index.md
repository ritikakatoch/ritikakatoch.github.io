 I'm Ritika Katoch, a final-year engineering student at Chitkara University. I'm passionate about full-stack development and enjoy delving into design patterns. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies, continually seeking to enhance my skills and knowledge in the tech world.

When I'm not coding, I'm often immersed in the world of anime, exploring different genres and enjoying the storytelling. I also love traveling and capturing moments with my camera, as well as dabbling in painting.
